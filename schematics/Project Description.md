We provide a plathora of features to make the life of college students much easier. 
Students can ensure they don't fall short on attendance in any subject by tracking their attendance easily without having to download an additional app for the same.
If that wasn't enough to maintain a good attendance, we also give custom reminders to the user to attend class or for personal use as well, a few minutes in advance so that they don't accidentally miss out on anything.
We also provide an avenue for students to set their time tables where they can add their classes as well as other events of their choice.
The app will also have a  designated resource for study material which would include previous year papers, documents, e-books as well as playlists links related to the subjects they have enrolled in. 
Apart from all these features which make sure that a student can plan out their academic college life and manage it extremely conveniently, our feature PecSocial allows students to delve into their social college lifes as well, by providing them a platform to be able to see public features of other students whom they can look for based on their names, SIDs or even clubs they are part of. This allows students to be able to stay in touch with their actual college lives and not only get bundled up with the academic side of it. 
All these features ensure the student a hassle free all-in-one application for the entirety of their college life.
